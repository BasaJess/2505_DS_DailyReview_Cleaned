## General Remarks

> safe environment and code of conduct
- be respectful
- don't make assumptions
- help each other
- share resources (on slack)
- be very patient
- we are all here to learn

> each day will start with the  **daily review** (9:00-10:00 am)
- discussing protocol of the day before
- discussing coding exercises and/or rapid assessment test
- answering open questions

> extras:
if you want to learn some extra thing/ go deeper, ask the coaches (there should not be the feeling of missing out)

## Data Science

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field:
![Venn-Diagram. Data Science consists of Math and Statistics, Computer Science and IT and Domain Knowledge](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*mgXvzNcwfpnBawI6XTkVRg.png)


During a Data Science Project, Data Scientists will go through the Data Science Life-Cycle multiple times.

## Git and Github
### Set-Up
* Creating an SSH key from the terminal and connecting it to GitHub [tutorial](https://github.com/neuefische/ds-getting-started/blob/main/2_GitHub_SSH.md)
--> this will save us the effort to always enter our github password whenever we want to connect to github from the terminal.

### General Intro
Git is a version control system (vcs), which is used to keep track of changes and versions of code.
Github is a provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. This makes it easy to work on projects together. GitHub is the "social network of code".
>**Rule #1**: Don't put data on github!

>**Rule #2**: Every repository (project folder) should have a ```README.md``` file. (Showcase that you document your code. This is an important skill when working in teams, make your code as easy to read by others as possible).

### Git usage
To copy a Git repository to our local machine we use the command:
```zsh
git clone <LINK>
```

in the shell. Remember, after we set-up the SSH-Key, the <LINK> should be in the ssh-format!

## Pyenv -virtual python environment

### Set-up
follow the instructions in the [ds-getting-started](https://github.com/neuefische/ds-getting-started/) repo.

>Not used: miniconda part!
### Create new virtual environment

**Make sure you are in the right working directory!** You want to be able to create a new virtual environment for each project (=repository) you are working on.

```zsh
pyenv local 3.11.3 # set local python version
python -m venv .venv # create new virtual environment, all infos saved in .venv-folder
source .venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
```

You can install packages with ```pip```

```zsh
pip install <package_name>
```

To check which packages and versions are installed, use

```zsh
pip freeze
```

Deactivate your virtual environment when you're done:

```zsh
deactivate
```

**Troubleshooting**: to check if you're using the right python version you can check:
```zsh
python --version # is it saying what you expect?
which python # is it pointing to the place you expect your python to be?
# for example if you activated the pyenv and .venv there should be a .venv in the path and no conda
```
