## General Remarks

> **Version Control is Crucial!**
- Git helps track changes and collaborate effectively.
- GitHub hosts repositories and enables teamwork.
- Good commit messages and structured branches enhance productivity.
- Never store sensitive data (passwords, API keys) on GitHub!

## Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a **Version Control System (VCS)** that helps manage code changes over time. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without conflicts. 

GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and version tracking.

### Key Concepts
- **Repository**: A project folder managed by Git.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes.
- **Branch**: An independent line of development.
- **Merge**: Combining different branches.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge changes into another branch.

> **Rule #1**: Don't push large data files to GitHub!

> **Rule #2**: Always include a `README.md` file to document your repository.

## Git Installation and Configuration

### Install Git
Follow the instructions on [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Configure Git (Run these commands after installation)
```zsh
# Set your name and email (important for commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Check your configuration
git config --list
```

---
## Basic Git Commands

### Initialize a Git Repository
```zsh
git init
```
This sets up a new Git repository in the current directory.

### Clone an Existing Repository
```zsh
git clone <repository_url>
```
Downloads a copy of a remote repository to your local machine.

### Checking Repository Status
```zsh
git status
```
Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

### Staging and Committing Changes
```zsh
git add <file>   # Stage a specific file
git add .        # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
Saves changes with a descriptive message.

### Viewing Commit History
```zsh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
Displays a concise commit history with branches.

---
## Working with Branches

### Create and Switch to a New Branch
```zsh
git branch <branch_name>  # Create a branch
git checkout <branch_name>  # Switch to the branch
git switch <branch_name>    # Alternative to checkout
```

### Merge a Branch
```zsh
git checkout main  # Switch to the main branch
git merge <branch_name>  # Merge another branch into main
```

### Delete a Branch
```zsh
git branch -d <branch_name>  # Delete a branch locally
git push origin --delete <branch_name>  # Delete a branch remotely
```

---
## Pushing and Pulling from GitHub

### Push Local Changes to GitHub
```zsh
git push origin <branch_name>
```
Uploads your commits to a remote repository.

### Pull the Latest Changes
```zsh
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository.

---
## Collaboration on GitHub

### Forking a Repository
Forking creates a copy of another user's repository under your GitHub account. You can modify it without affecting the original project.

### Creating a Pull Request (PR)
1. Push changes to your branch.
2. Go to the repository on GitHub.
3. Click **New Pull Request**.
4. Select your branch and target branch.
5. Add a description and submit the PR.

### Handling Merge Conflicts
When Git cannot merge changes automatically, conflicts occur.
```zsh
git merge <branch_name>
```
Git will highlight conflicts in affected files. Edit the files, resolve conflicts, and commit the changes.
```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```
