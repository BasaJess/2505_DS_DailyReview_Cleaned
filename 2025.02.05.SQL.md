## Summary: Introduction to Databases

### Datatypes
There are several types of data. For each type, there are different ways to store it.

|type of data |explanation| examples|database|
|----|---|---|---|
|**unstructered**|not conform to a rigid structure.|free text, images, audio| _object store_, e.g. AWS S3|
|**semi-structured**|conforms to a schema but deviations are possible|CSV, JSON|e. g. MongoDB, Elastic Search|
|**structured**|Schema and types of data are known and encoded in the system|| e.g. SQL, DBeaver...|

### Databases: What are databases?
A database is a **systematic collection of data** (today: mainly stored electronicly). 

### Types of databases
There a different types of databases, e. g. **(1) Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** and **(2) NoSQL Databases**.

We now look closer at Relational Database Management Systems.

### Relational Database Management System

- a relational database represents a mini-world (e.g. Airport)
- it have a predefined schema
- the relationship between data is relational
- Examples: Postgres, MySql, Oracle, SQLite
- Languages: SQL

> _Background Information_: Edgar W. Codd (1923-2003) invented the relational data model in 1970

- **Schema:** A database consists of one/multiple schemas. The schema contains all entities that are related in some way.
    - **Entity(= Table):** A schema consists of multiple entities=tables. A table consists of columns and rows.
        - **Attribute = Field = Column**: a variable with a unique name
        - **Observation = record = Row**: a entry
            - **Value**: Every cell is  a single value

---

### Entity-Relationship-Model (ER-Model)
Before you create a database, you should think about how to structure all the data. Therefore you can create a ER-Model.

In the ER-Model each entity(table) is a box with a unique name (written at the top). The names of the different attributes(columns) including their data types are listed under the table name. You won't find any observations(rows)/values in a ER-model!

![ER-Model Example](./er-model.png)


To create the relation, we have to look at special attributes: **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.
- **primary keys:** Each entity(=table) should have a primary key, e.g. id. This primary key is unique for each record(=row). _Primary keys can't be NULL! Often ‘artificial’ unique identifiers are used as keys (surrogate key). If a table hasn't a primary key, you don't need this table!_

- **foreign keys:** A foreign key is a attribute(=column) (or collection of attributes) in one table, that refers to the primary key in another entity(=table)

**!!!a primary or foreign keys could consist of one or more attributes**

There are different kind of relations:
 - **One-to-one (1:1)**: e.g.you have the entities _person_ and _jobcenter_. Every person, who is unemployed and registered at the jobcenter, has a specific jobcenter_id, which won't change. Every jobcenter_id belongs to a single person.
- **One-to-many (1:n) or many-to-one (n:1)**: e.g. you have the entities _jobcenter_ and _contact-person_. Each person registered in the jobcenter  has a single contact person. But contact-persons have multiple jobcenter-clients.
- **many-to-many (n:n)**: e.g. you have the entities _jobcenter_ and _jobposting_. Every person registered in the jobcenter might have multiple jobposting. And a single jobposting is sent to differend persons. **Usually a many-to-many relation is implemented with a join table _Person-posting_ with two one-to-many relationships. The join table contains as foreign keys the primary keys from both referenced tables.**

## Summary: SQL
> Background-Information: SQL (Structured Query Language)  is the most widely used language for relational databases. The history of SQL begins in 1975.

With SQL we can:
- **define** databases and tables
- **manipulate** data (execute queries, insert/update/delete records, retrieve data)
- **control** the database (set permissions on tables, procedures, and views)

### SQL Query Syntax

|keyword| function|
|---|---|
|SELECT|Returns the final data|
|FROM|Choose tables to get base data|
|WHERE|Filters the base data|
|GROUP BY|Aggregates the base data|
|HAVING|Filters the aggregated data|
|ORDER BY|Sorts the final data|
|LIMIT|Limits the returned data to a row count|

See [examples](https://neuefische.github.io/nf-ds-onl-en-2701-book/sessions/05.2_Intro_to_SQL.html)


### Main learnings from exercises:
- The order of an SQL query (Select from wehere...) must be respected. 
- Variables are not possible like in python
- You can concatenate different WHERE clauses with AND, OR, NOT (only there you use bool-operators, elswhere use comma!)
    ```sql
   WHERE age > 20 AND gender = 'female'
   ```
- you can use AS (alias) in the SELECT clause to specify what u want to call the column
- In the select cause you can aggregate data with **MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), COUNT(), SUM()**. If you use one of them, then the **GROUP BY** might be also helpful.
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(age) AS avg_age, p.gender
    FROM persons 
    GROUP BY gender;
   ```
- You can nested queries!
