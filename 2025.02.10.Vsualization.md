# Visualization Part 1



## <span style="color:black"> __Basic Overview: Gestalt Principles__ </span>
 
Gestalt (=pattern) principles are guidelines for visualizing data.

Important things to consider when presenting data:
* <span style="color:grey"> The message to the audience should be as clear as possible.
* <span style="color:grey"> Via the visualization you can emphasize your message. It helps to underline the grouping with the spoken text.
* <span style="color:grey"> Be very careful when presenting results, clearly explain what you are showing.

<span style="color:grey">

Proximity
* Things close to each other are grouped
* The brain groups objects which are near to each other

Similarity
* Things that look similar to each other are grouped
* Grouping by different colors, shapes & sizes

Enclosure
* Things with a boundary around them are grouped.
* Very powerful, e.g., more powerful than proximity.

Closure
* We like seeing closed shapes.
* The brain is completing shapes.

Continuity
* The brain likes to continue shapes and lines and likes order.
* Objects are grouped if they're aligned or conformed.

Connection
* Things excplicitly connected to each other are connected.
* Connection more powerful than similarity. It can underline other principles, e.g. color.

# Connection and enclosure are the most powerful principles!


## <span style="color:black"> __Hints for a good visualization__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">

* Make it legible
* Eliminate clutter
* Parameters for improvement: legend, fonts & sizes, axes, ticks
* Be clear about your most important points, your core message, what you want to show and to whom (audience).
* Emphasize on foreground data and de-emphasize background data.

Best Practices:
* Use color with intention! The most important color is grey. See also the Seaborn color palettes: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html
* Use annotations
* Choose the right chart

## <span style="color:black"> __Fetching the data__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">
We can reduce steps by connecting to a PostgreSQL database from Python directly, eliminating the need for a separate SQL client. We looked at two different ways to connect:

* psycopg2
* sqlalchemy

For the detailed explanation, please see https://github.com/neuefische/ds-visualisation/blob/main/1_Fetching_the_data.ipynb
