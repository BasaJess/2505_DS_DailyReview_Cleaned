## <span style="color:black"> __Steps of Exploratory Data Analysis__ </span>

### 1. Understanding the Dataset
<span style="color:black"> 

 -  Checking structure
 - Identifying data types
</span>

### 2. Handling Missing Values
- Checking for missing data, and then:
    - Removal 
    - Imputation
    - replacement

### 3. Identifying Outliers
- Using Visualizations
    - Boxplots 
    - Histograms
    - Scatter plots
- Using Statistical methods 
    - IQR

### 4. Detecting Data Inconsistencies

- Duplicate records 
- Incorrect formats (dates, categorical labels)
- String inconsistencies (e.g., "USA" vs. "U.S.")

### (Next step: 5.  Feature Engineering and Transformation)

## <span style="color:black"> __Visualizing Data for EDA__ </span>

Why is visualization important? Because averages can be misleading. In the image below thin about what it would mean if x is income and y is the number of people in a given society:

#### <span style="color:black"> 1. Univariate Analysis (Understanding Distributions) </span>
Used to analyze a single variable at a time.
- Histograms (for distributions)
- Boxplots (to detect outliers)

#### <span style="color:black"> 2. Bivariate Analysis (Finding Relationships)
 </span>

Used to compare two variables and detect patterns.
- Scatter Plots (continuous data correlation)
- Pairplots (multiple comparisons)
#### <span style="color:black"> 3. Correlation Analysis (Finding Feature Relationships)
Helps in feature selection by identifying strongly correlated variables.
- Heatmaps (visualizing correlations)

## Confirmation Bias in EDA
Seeking, interpreting, and favoring data that supports our preexisting beliefs while ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence.

### **Examples of Confirmation Bias in EDA**

- Removing outliers without understanding their cause because they "don’t fit the pattern."
- "Arguements" against DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion)


### **How to Avoid Confirmation Bias in EDA**
- Don't try to **“prove”** anything.  
- **Visualize from Multiple Angles** before drawing conclusions.  
- **Check for Alternative Explanations** 
 Correlation ≠ causation. Always consider external factors. Consider these:
    - Why would women who own horses be healthier?
    - Why do antivaxxers believe vaccines cause autism?
- **Involve Others**, they  help catch unintentional bias in analysis.

## <span style="color:black"> __Degrees of Freedom in EDA__ </span> 
The number of **independent values** in a dataset that **can vary** while still maintaining **a fixed total** or constraint.

- If you have a dataset of size **n**, once the mean is calculated, only **n - 1** values are truly free to vary. 
- **One** value is no longer free to vary because it must be determined by the mean to maintain the correct total sum of values.
