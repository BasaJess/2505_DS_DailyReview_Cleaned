## <span style="color:black"> __First Content Notes__ </span>
<span style="color:grey">

* Good communication, clear roles and collaboration are key to successful coding teams.

* A **function** is a block of code that performs a specific task.
* Given an input (**arguments**), it executes operations and returns an  output.
* A function allows code to be executed multiple times, improving readability and simplifying bug fixing.

## <span style="color:black"> How to work in a coding team </span>
* Hold meetings about:
    * Costumer and user requirements to define the purpose of the project and understand the key objectives of the project
    * Required functions and features that the software must support - writing pseudocode in natural language helps to break down complex features before coding
    * Infrastructure needs - such as servers, cloud solutions, databases to handle future growth and fulfill performance and security requirements

* Before debugging, testing by an independent person ensures a neutral perspective on bugs and errors and promotes objective feedback
* Code quality and best practices including clear naming conventions, modular code and proper documentation
* Use Version Control Systems like GitHub and define the roles in advance

## Write a function
* functions start with *def*, function_name and parentheses
* the function body must be indented
* a return statement is optional and don't have to be necessarily on the end of the function

* A parameter is the variable defined in the function. It is the placeholder for the values (arguments) you pass to the function when calling it.
* While calling a function you can use positional and keyword arguments or even a mix of them. But after calling the first keyword argument, every other argument has to be one as well.
* Default values can be written in the first line in the definition of the function. 
* Using `*args` and `**kwargs` makes it easier to define functions that can take an arbitrary number of parameters, without needing to change the function signature when you add new arguments. 

```python 
def multiply(*args):
    result = 1
    for num in args:
        result *= num
    return result

print(multiply(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 24
```

## <span style="color:black"> Types of functions </span>

<span style="color:grey">

### 1. Built-in functions  
* can be used **directly**
* e. g.: print( ), len( ), sum( ), type( )
### 2. User-defined functions
* created by the user to perform **specific** tasks
* e. g.: create_board( ), assign_symbol( ) in the coding challenge
### 3. Lambda Functions
* one-line functions, which don't require a *def* statement
```python 
square = lambda x: x ** 2

#Call the function
square(5) #25
```
### 4. Recursive function  
* functions that call themselves 
```python  
    def factorial(n): 
        if  n == 0:
            return 1
        return n * factorial(n-1) 
```

### 5. Higher-order function
*  Function that take other functions as arguments or return them as results

```python
    def multiply_by(n): 
        def multiplier(x):
            return x * n
        return multiplier 
```
### 6. Generator

* Functions that iterate over a sequence and generate items one by one without creating the entire list in memory. They're using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. 

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    count = 1
    while count <= n:
        yield count
        count += 1

gen = count_up_to(3)
print(next(gen))  # Output: 1
print(next(gen))  # 2
print(next(gen))  # 3
```

### 7. Decorator
* Functions that modify or enhance other functions without changing their source code.

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()

#Output:
Before function call
Hello!
After function call
```

</span>
